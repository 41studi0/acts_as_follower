Testing
==============

Tests are written with the standard Rails setup of Test::Unit and run using rake.


Setup
=======

Create a new Rails app, and add acts_as_follower as a plugin.

By default the tests database uses mysql. 
You can make the test database uses in-memory sqlite. This requires the appropriate library:

sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby

If you wish to use mysql instead, create a database as specified in test/database.yml.


Running
=======

From the command line, within the acts_as_follower directory:

rake test   # For mysql

or:

DB=sqlite rake test    # For sqlite


Coverage
=======

Test coverage can be calculated using Rcov. Make sure you have the rcov gem installed.

Again in the acts_as_follower directory:

rake rcov:gen   # For sqlite

or:

DB=mysql rake rcov:gen   # For mysql

The coverage will now be available in the test/coverage directory.

rake rcov:clobber will delete the coverage directory.
